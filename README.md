# Sloganizer-API-Python
Sloganizer.net API python

### Steps to have a slogan every time you log into a shell:
1) make the script executable by 'chown +x slogan.py'
2) add to end of your '.zshrc' (or '.bashrc') '~/Path/to/script/slogan.py'
3) done

Notes:
You dont have to worry that you can't get into your shell if the Slogan website is down.
There just wont be a message no more.
